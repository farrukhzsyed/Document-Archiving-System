Quick Facts:

Acute HIV, a highly infectious stage of the disease, can last greater than 10 weeks.
Between 5,000 to 75,000 patients are misdiagnosed annually.
One in seven people with HIV do not know they are infected.
There were nearly 40,000 new HIV diagnoses in the U.S. in 2016.
Even if physicians do test, traditional HIV diagnostic tests may not detect acute HIV.
Early detection leads to very manageable treatment options.

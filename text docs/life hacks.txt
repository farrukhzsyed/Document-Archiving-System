SO HOW DO WE DO THIS FULL-LIFE HACK?

1. Spend 30 minutes being active with your family two to three times a week by taking a fun walk in a place you know well. Give each family member time to lead the group and choose which direction you take.

2. Focus on the time you spend being active together – not on the distance you cover.

3. Add some active moves by playing follow-the-leader, jumping over sidewalk cracks – or stopping every five minutes to do jumping jacks, squats or lunges.

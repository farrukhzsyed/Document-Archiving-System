A Midsummer Night’s Dream Shakespeare
In Athens, Greece, a young man, Demetrius, has a problem.
‘Please, Hermia. I love you!’
‘No, Demetrius. I love Lysander!’
‘Love is never easy! Let’s run away together!’
Helena is Hermia’s friend. She loves Demetrius.
‘Demetrius, you know Hermia is running away to the forest with Lysander ...’
‘I’m going to follow them.’
‘Well, I’m going to follow you.’
In the forest, the fairy king Oberon wants to play a trick on Titania, his queen.
‘Go and find a magic flower! I’ll put the juice in your eyes. It will make you fall in love
with the first thing you see.’
